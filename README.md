# Dot files

My (mostly) up to date dot-files, currently on 1440p monitor so might look a bit large/wrong on a 1080p screen. A lot of the rofi/polybar stuff are based on adi1090x's polybar/rofi themes. To get the fonts/icons working you'll need to install the fonts from [adi1090x's repo](https://github.com/adi1090x/polybar-themes) and install `inter-font`, `noto-fonts` and `ttf-jetbrains-mono`. Sidenote that polybar might also complain if you're using a 1080p monitor, just adjust the width in `polybar/config.ini`.
