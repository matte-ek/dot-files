Thank you for checking out my dot files! I would like to thank adi1090x for his [polybar themes](https://github.com/adi1090x/polybar-themes), which mine is based upon. (The material one to be specific.) Therefore if you have any issues with missing fonts, please check out his repository and make sure to install the included fonts. Also thanks PrayagS for your nice [polybar spotify script](https://github.com/PrayagS/polybar-spotify).

Quick FAQ from the Reddit post:
* How is the blur achieved? Using picom and the kawase blur (also provided in the picom config), for this to work you need to run picom with `--experimental-backends` however. My i3 config should be doing this automatically.
* VS Code Theme? [Ayu Dark Bordered](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=teabyii.ayu), however the real magic comes from the [GlassIt-VSC extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=s-nlf-fh.glassit) making the background blurry and slightly transparent.
